a. What is an issue?
An issue is a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs in a project. It's a discussion thread where project contributors can report problems, suggest new features, or start conversations about the project.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. When you create a pull request, you ask others to review the changes you've made before they are merged into the main branch.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Push the branch with your changes to GitHub.
Go to the repository on GitHub.
Click on the Compare & pull request button next to the branch you pushed.
Provide a title and description for your pull request.
Click on Create pull request.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)?
Go to the repository on GitHub.
Click on Settings.
Click on Collaborators.
Enter the GitHub username or email of the person you want to add.
Click on Add collaborator.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and track changes to your code. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories online, allowing collaboration, pull requests, and issue tracking.

f. What does git diff do?
The git diff command shows the differences between the working directory and the index (staging area), or between two commits, helping you see what changes have been made.

g. What is the main branch?
The main branch (previously called master) is the primary branch where the final version of your project is stored. It's usually the default branch that you see when you visit a repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, it is best practice to create a new branch for your changes and open a pull request. This allows others to review and approve the changes before they are merged into the main branch.
